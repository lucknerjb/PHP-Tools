DB-Wrapper is a database wrapper built to reduce the amount of repetitive mysql calls made.

It does not yet procide method chaining and other cool features but it does facilitate writing queries:

Example:

//SELECT

$conn = new DatabaseWrapper();
$result = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM clients WHERE client_id='{$client_id}'");
$row = $conn->fetchArray($result);

//INSERT
$conn = new DatabaseWrapper();
$conn->iquery("INSERT INTO clients (client_id, client_name) VALUES ('1000', 'Test Name')");
$lastID = $conn->lastID();
