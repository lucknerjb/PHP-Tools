Ever had to manually change a password in a database but with no access to phpmyadmin?

Ever had to compare the password in the database to one that you have in mind but don't want to write code to do so?

Try the MD5 tool.

Example output:




Your clear text password : test

Your MD5 equivalent : 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6

Copy, paste, and enjoy!
